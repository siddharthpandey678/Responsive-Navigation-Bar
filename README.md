Responsive Navigation Bar using HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This project is a Responsive Navigation Bar created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The navigation bar automatically adapts to different screen sizes and provides a smooth user experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

On smaller screens, the menu converts into a hamburger menu, which can be toggled using JavaScript.
CSS media queries are used to handle responsiveness, while JavaScript manages the open and close functionality of the menu.

The project is lightweight, easy to customize, and built using pure vanilla JavaScript without any external libraries.
It is suitable for beginners to understand responsive design, media queries, and basic DOM manipulation for real-world websites.
